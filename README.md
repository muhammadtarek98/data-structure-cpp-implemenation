# Data Structure C++ implementation
## Table of Contents
## Overview

This project provides a collection of C++ implementations for several fundamental data structures and algorithms. The goal is to demonstrate how these structures work internally, making the code a useful reference for learning and future enhancements.

## Implemented Data Structures

- **Linked List**: Includes functions for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Stack**: Provides standard stack operations such as push, pop, and peek.
- **Queue**: A simple implementation of the queue data structure.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Features insertion, search, and traversal operations.
- **Heap Sort**: Contains the implementation of the heap sort algorithm.
- **Tree Traversals**: Demonstrates pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals.

## Features

- **Educational Resource**: Clear, modular implementations that serve as both a learning tool and a reference.
- **Modular Code Organization**: Each data structure is implemented separately to ease navigation and reuse.
- **CMake Support**: Comes with a `CMakeLists.txt` file to streamline the build process.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies ensure easy compilation and portability.

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler that supports C++17 (or later).
